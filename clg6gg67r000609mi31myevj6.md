## Introduction

In today's fast-paced work environment, collaboration is key to success. However, with team members working remotely or from different locations, it can be challenging to stay on the same page. That's why ILLA Cloud is excited to announce its newest feature: real-time collaboration. With this new feature, users can see each other's mouse movements, word typing, and the components and resources they're adding to the canvas or working tools. Here's everything you need to know about this exciting new feature.

## How ILLA Cloud's real-time collaboration works

ILLa Cloud's real-time collaboration feature is a groundbreaking addition to the low-code tool industry. Powered by advanced algorithms and server-side optimizations, it delivers a seamless collaboration experience for users working on the same project.

When users collaborate on a project, each person's actions are synchronized and displayed to others in real time. Mouse movements are incredibly smooth, refreshing every 50ms, ensuring that users can accurately track their collaborators' actions. As team members type words, the text appears on everyone's screen simultaneously, allowing for immediate feedback and editing. Additionally, when users add components and resources to the canvas or working tools, their actions are visible to all collaborators in real time, fostering a transparent and efficient work environment.

## Benefits of ILLA Cloud's real-time collaboration

ILLa Cloud's real-time collaboration offers numerous benefits that can transform the way teams work together, such as:

1. Increased efficiency: Real-time collaboration enables team members to work together simultaneously, reducing wait times and speeding up the overall development process.
    
2. Improved communication: By visualizing each other's actions, team members gain a better understanding of their colleagues' thought processes and can more easily communicate their own ideas.
    
3. Enhanced decision-making: Real-time collaboration allows teams to make faster, more informed decisions, as they can quickly discuss and review each other's work.
    
4. Better project outcomes: By streamlining communication and collaboration, teams can achieve higher-quality results and reduce the likelihood of errors or misunderstandings.
    

Real-time collaboration on a low-code platform, like ILLA Cloud, can significantly improve the process of building internal tools. Here are some examples of how this feature can be utilized:

1. Dashboard creation: When designing a dashboard for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), team members can collaborate in real-time to add, edit, and arrange various data visualization components. By working together, they can ensure that the dashboard effectively displays the most relevant information and caters to the needs of different stakeholders.
    
2. Workflow automation: As teams work on automating internal processes, real-time collaboration can help streamline the creation and testing of automation workflows. Team members can simultaneously build and edit the flowchart, adding triggers, actions, and conditions while discussing the most efficient solutions.
    
3. Form design: When creating internal forms for data collection or processing requests, real-time collaboration allows team members to work together on designing the form layout, adding necessary fields, and setting validation rules. This can help ensure that the form captures all the required information and adheres to the company's data standards.
    
4. Custom reporting tool: When building a custom reporting tool, real-time collaboration can help facilitate the process of selecting relevant data sources, defining filters, and designing the report layout. Team members can discuss the specific needs of the end users, share their expertise in data analysis, and ensure that the final report is both accurate and user-friendly.
    
5. Internal communication platform: If a team is tasked with building a custom internal communication platform, real-time collaboration can be invaluable. Team members can work together on designing the user interface, integrating messaging features, and incorporating additional tools like calendars, file sharing, or task management. By collaborating in real time, the team can create a more cohesive and efficient communication solution.
    

In each of these examples, real-time collaboration in ILLA Cloud allows team members to combine their skills and knowledge, leading to more effective internal tools that meet the specific needs of their organization.

## How to use real-time collaboration in ILLA Cloud

To make the most of ILLA Cloud's real-time collaboration feature, follow these simple steps:

2. Invite your team members to join your ILLA Cloud workspace by sending them an invitation link or adding them manually with their email addresses.
    
3. Create a new project or open an existing one. You can choose from a variety of templates or start from scratch.
    
4. As your team members join the project, their cursors and names appear on the canvas or working tools. This allows you to see who is working on what in real time.
    
5. Start building tools and resources with your team in real time. You can add components, edit text, and create connections between elements as you collaborate.
    

To further enhance your collaborative experience, consider these tips:

* Use online meeting software to communicate with your team members as you work together. This can help clarify questions, share ideas, and coordinate tasks without leaving the ILLA Cloud platform.
