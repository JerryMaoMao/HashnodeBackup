Do you need to build internal tools for your business, such as dashboards, CRM, workflows, automation, and more? Do you want to save time and resources by using a low-code platform that lets you connect to your data sources, drag and drop components, and write queries using SQL and JavaScript? Do you want to use a platform that supports your preferred language and makes it easy for you to understand and customize your application?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should try ILLA Cloud, the open-source low-code platform for building internal tools. ILLA Cloud is a powerful and flexible UI library for building web applications that connect to your databases and APIs, such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Stripe, Google Sheets, AWS S3, and more. You can also use ILLA Cloud to integrate with any data source connected through APIs.

With ILLA Cloud, you can build a user interface (UI) for your application by dragging and dropping components like tables, charts, forms, buttons, and more. You can also write queries to interact with your data using SQL and JavaScript. You can use template syntax to inject dynamic values into your components and queries, and add logic, transform data, and define complex workflows.

ILLA Cloud is also an open-source project that welcomes contributions from developers worldwide. You can join our GitHub repository and help us improve the codebase, fix bugs, add features, write documentation, and more. You can also join our Discord community and chat with other users and developers, share feedback, ask questions, and get support.
