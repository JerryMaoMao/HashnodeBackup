Internal tools are software applications that are used by businesses to streamline their internal processes, improve productivity, and enhance customer experience. Internal tools range from simple dashboards and reports to complex workflows and automation systems.

Some examples of internal tools are:

* Customer relationship management (CRM) tools that help sales and marketing teams manage leads, contacts, and deals
    
* Inventory management tools that help operations and logistics teams track and optimize stock levels, orders, and deliveries.
    
* Human resources (HR) tools that help HR teams manage employee data, payroll, benefits, and performance reviews
    
* Data analysis tools that help data teams collect, process, visualize, and share insights from various sources of data
    

Internal tools are essential for any business that wants to grow and scale efficiently. However, building internal tools can be challenging, time-consuming, and costly. Traditional methods of building internal tools involve hiring developers, writing code, setting up servers, and maintaining infrastructure. This can take months or even years to complete, depending on the complexity and scope of the project. Moreover, this can divert resources and attention away from the core business activities and customer needs.

Fortunately, a better way to build internal tools is by using low code platforms. Low-code platforms are software solutions that enable users to create internal tools without writing much code or dealing with technical details. Low-code platforms provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to drag and drop components, configure settings, and connect data sources. Low-code platforms also handle the internal tools' hosting, deployment, security, and scalability.

By using low code platforms, users can build internal tools faster, easier, and cheaper than coding from scratch. Low code platforms also empower non-technical users, such as business analysts, product managers, and domain experts, to create internal tools without relying on developers. This can improve collaboration, innovation, and agility within the organization.

## How do internal tools help businesses to do better?

Internal tools are software applications that are custom-made and used within an organization to help its internal users work better and faster. They can vary from simple tools that do one thing, such as a spreadsheet or a database GUI, to complex tools that do many things, such as a dashboard or a CRM. Internal tools are highly adapted to an organization’s processes, needs, and goals.

Some of the ways that internal tools can improve your business are:

* They can increase your productivity and performance by:
    
    * Automating repetitive or tedious tasks, such as data entry, reporting, or invoicing
        
    * Streamlining your workflows and eliminating bottlenecks, such as manual approvals, handoffs, or dependencies
        
    * Providing you with real-time data and insights that can help you monitor your performance, identify opportunities and challenges, and make informed decisions
        
* They can improve your collaboration and communication by:
    
    * Facilitating information sharing, feedback, and coordination among your teams and departments, especially if you have remote or distributed workers
        
    * Improving transparency and accountability by tracking your progress and results and allowing you to see who is doing what, when, and how
        
    * Fostering a culture of trust, engagement, and innovation in your organization
        
* They can reduce your costs and risks by:
    
    * Saving you time and money by eliminating the need for external software vendors or developers
        
    * Reducing errors, bugs, and security breaches by ensuring data quality and compliance
        
    * Increasing your profitability and sustainability
        

Internal tools are also beneficial for your employees. They can:

* Improve employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention by empowering them with the right tools to do their jobs well
    
* Improve employee skills, knowledge, and creativity by allowing them to learn new things, solve problems, and experiment with new ideas.
