## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building a WebUI for LoRA fine-tuned Stable Diffusion Model in ILLA Cloud

### Step 1: Creating an Intuitive Front-end Interface

In this initial phase, we embark on building a seamless front-end interface using a user-friendly drag-and-drop approach. By strategically placing essential [components](https://www.illacloud.com/components) like input fields, buttons, images, and more, we lay the foundation for an interactive user experience. Once the [components](https://www.illacloud.com/components) are in place, we fine-tune their styles to achieve a polished and aesthetically pleasing webpage. The result is a complete webpage that serves as the canvas for the subsequent development stages.

### Step 2: Leveraging Hugging Face Inference API for Resource and Action Creation

To create resources and actions for the Stable Diffusion model, we harness the power of the Hugging Face Inference API. This API facilitates [seamless integration](https://www.illacloud.com/integrations) with the model, allowing us to deploy two distinct models: "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5" and "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1." For this purpose, we select the "Hugging Face Inference API," ensuring efficient and effective utilization of the Stable Diffusion model within our project.

Kindly input the Model ID and Parameter in the Action configuration panel. To retrieve the selected model from radioGroup1, please set the Model ID as {{radioGroup1.value}}. As for the input, since it originates from the input field, set the parameter as {{input1.value}}. Your configuration should align with the image provided below for reference.

### Step 5: Comprehensive Testing

After diligently following the preceding four steps, your progress reaches a crucial point where comprehensive testing becomes imperative. To achieve a fully functional and efficient tool, consider incorporating additional [components](https://www.illacloud.com/components) and data sources. You have the option to leverage other models to enhance prompt generation or store prompts in localStorage or a database for better accessibility. By implementing all these steps, you can witness the complete outcome of your efforts, yielding a powerful and feature-rich tool that can cater to a wide array of tasks and deliver exceptional performance. Take the time to thoroughly test and fine-tune your tool to ensure it meets the highest standards of functionality and usability.
