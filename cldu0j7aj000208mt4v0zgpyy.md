There weren’t many **business applications** available at the start of this century. However, in the past two decades, so many **mobile apps** and **business apps** have come to the market that they can easily overwhelm an organization. So, how to unburden yourself from the various unnecessary apps?

The answer is **low code development tools**. If you are a company that underwent digital transformation quite a while ago, chances are high that your organization is suffering under a pile of useless **business applications**. Such a condition can slow down your company’s daily activity.

Plus, it will increase frustration among your staff who have to find their way through that garbage pile. You must consolidate in this situation. Trim all those apps and bring everything into one streamlined common platform. And you will be surprised to find out how many unnecessary apps you were paying for.

If your business is a busy one, you frequently need to **build internal tools**. This requires two things. Firstly, professional-level **coding skills** and knowledge. And secondly, a list of **business applications** and SaaS subscriptions.

Often, multiple applications on this list serve the same purpose. Which means you are hoarding software and creating a digital mess. Meanwhile, you are also paying unnecessary fees, aka, losing money.

You can solve this by using ILLA Cloud - currently one of the most popular **low-code development tools**. Both **professional developers** and **citizen developers** with little to no **coding knowledge** can benefit from it. ILLA Cloud can quickly optimize your business process and let you enjoy the benefits of low code development.

A platform like [ILLA Cloud](about:blank) brings all your staff under one roof. Working in a single space is of course more convenient than in a dispersed state.

When your company is cluttered with too many **business apps**, the employees have to spend a lot of time and energy just deciding on the right tool for the job. This leaves them with little to contribute to the actual project.

After deploying ILLA Cloud, you will easily be able to recognize the apps that serve no purpose in your organization and get rid of them.

### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/5-reasons-to-save-tools-with-illa#2-maintain-one-integrated-library)**2\. Maintain One Integrated Library**

When you are looking for **rapid application development**, it can be frustrating if you have to write codes and basic inserts. Not only does this burn the coder out, but it also prevents him/her from inputting their best in the **development process**. In a business organization, this can mean decreased productivity.

The low-code platform ILLA Cloud offers a rich library of inserts. Your staff can simply drag and drop them when they have to **build internal tools**. As a result, they can focus and make better the most important aspects of an application.

Apart from that, ILLA Cloud lets your staff easily connect to various mainstream databases through API. The users can make massive information interactions happen by writing a simple data call. Also, Illa skillfully integrates back-end and front-end data.

The centralized nature of the platform also helps you in the management of important files. As your documents aren’t scattered across numerous apps and non-connected systems, you can find them more easily. Otherwise, locating specific information will waste your time and effort.

### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/5-reasons-to-save-tools-with-illa#3-reduce-business-security-risks)**3\. Reduce Business Security Risks**

When your number of business tools increases, so do your business security risks. Numerous apps connected to your business mean an increasing number of systems are getting access to your sensitive information.

Plus, many apps collect user data without telling them directly. This can include passwords, future strategies, codes, etc.

When you consolidate your business tools with ILLA Cloud, you significantly reduce third-party access to your company data. Plus, a single mailbox lets you monitor the flow of information in and out of your company more closely. So, when something doesn’t seem right, you get to take immediate action.

Another way IILLA Cloud reduces security risk is by conserving your valuable data files. When you sign up for Illa’s cloud services, all your important files are secured in the cloud system. So, in the event of a physical or digital disaster, your company’s information is still safe.

### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/5-reasons-to-save-tools-with-illa#5-spend-less-on-hiring)**5\. Spend Less on Hiring**

Many companies have to outsource or hire staff on an ad hoc basis due to a lack of necessary designing or **coding skills** among the regular team. This is mostly the case with businesses that aren’t exclusively focused on technology and therefore lack employees with professional **coding knowledge**.

Using a **low-code development platform** like ILLA Cloud reduces the need to outsource coding-related tasks. Because the simple and suggestive layout of ILLA Builder makes it easy for even laymen to build mobile or business apps from scratch.
