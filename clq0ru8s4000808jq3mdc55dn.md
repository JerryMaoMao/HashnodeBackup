Hello, everyone.

This is Owen, currently serving as the CEO of ILLA Cloud. Before starting my own business, I worked as a developer at TikTok and Bytedance. I have always been a technology enthusiast!

## About our product:

ILLA Cloud is a very user-friendly open-source low-code tool. We have completed two years of iteration so far.

You can find us at [ILLA.Cloud](http://ILLA.Cloud)

GitHub at [https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder](https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder)

The stars on our GitHub repository are all from our users. We haven't engaged in any artificial actions, so the number of stars is not yet high. We are currently aiming for 10,000 stars, and we hope you can give us a star on Github if possible!

We are a plug-and-play low-code tool. We hope you can use it to solve the problem of building internal systems within your company.

We focus on various management backends that cannot be purchased off the shelf and can only be built using traditional front-end approaches.

As we all know, not many frontend developers enjoy working on backends. With our tool, you can create aesthetically pleasing internal tools, ensuring that your apps and web applications have a user-friendly management backend.

Many of our users have used our product to build their own internal AI tools. For example, they use our Agent to generate emails or use the low-code tool to build their own Stable Diffusion panel.

In our extensive work, we have supported a wide range of integrations, including mainstream databases and APIs. We have also established an official partnership with Hugging Face, ensuring that every user can quickly access models from Hugging Face and incorporate a wide range of AI capabilities into their products.

## About our Company

We were founded after New Year's Day in 2022. Our product has gone through two full years of iteration, and now we dare to promote it.

We believe that the users here have a strong pursuit of quality products! During the early stages of our establishment, we received funding from many famous venture capitals. So, you don't have to worry about our survival. 

We are grateful for the support of top investors in the open-source industry. We believe that open-source can make products thrive and grow. We sincerely invite everyone to join us in building our product.
