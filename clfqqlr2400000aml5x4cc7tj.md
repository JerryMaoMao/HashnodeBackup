Enterprise software is a term that refers to applications that are designed to meet the needs of large organizations, such as corporations, governments, or educational institutions. Enterprise software can help streamline business processes, improve efficiency, enhance collaboration, and support decision-making across various departments and functions.

However, choosing the right enterprise software for your business can be a daunting task. There are many types of enterprise software available in the market, each with its own features, benefits, and drawbacks. How do you know which one is best suited for your specific goals and challenges?

In this blog post, we will help you categorize different types of enterprise software and introduce you to some of the most popular ones in 2023. We will also recommend ILLA Cloud as a low-code platform that can help you accelerate your internal tools development.

## Categorizing Types of Enterprise Software

One way to categorize enterprise software is by its function or purpose. For example:

* Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems: These are integrated software solutions that manage various aspects of a businessâ€™s operations, such as accounting, finance, human resources, supply chain management, inventory control, etc.
    
* Customer relationship management (CRM) systems: These are software applications that help businesses manage their interactions with current and potential customers. They can help with sales automation, marketing campaigns, customer service support, lead generation, etc.
    
* Business intelligence (BI) systems: These are software tools that help businesses analyze data from various sources and generate insights for decision-making. They can help with reporting, dashboarding, data visualization, predictive analytics, etc.
    

Another way to categorize enterprise software is by its development approach or methodology. For example:

* Traditional development platforms: These are platforms that require developers to write code using programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, etc. They offer more flexibility and customization options but also require more time and resources.
    
* Low-code development platforms: These are platforms that enable developers to create applications using graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and drag-and-drop features. They automate aspects of the development process and reduce dependencies on traditional programming approaches. They offer faster delivery and easier maintenance but also have some limitations in terms of complexity and scalability.
