## Introduction

The demand for efficient and easy-to-use internal tools is on the rise, and low-code platforms have emerged as the go-to solution for businesses looking to streamline their internal processes. Retool and Tooljet are two popular low-code platforms that have attracted attention for their ability to build internal tools with ease. In this blog, we'll compare Retool and Tooljet, exploring their key features, use cases, and performance, and introduce ILLA Cloud as a supporting platform for app development and deployment.

## Retool

Retool is a widely-used low-code platform that makes it easy to build custom internal tools, including SQL GUIs and Airtable dashboards. With its extensive integration capabilities, Retool allows users to connect to various databases and APIs, making it a popular choice for developing Redis UIs and Airtable admin panels. Retool offers both self-hosted and cloud-based solutions, making it a flexible option for businesses of all sizes. However, some users may find Retool's pricing a bit steep, which has led to a search for open-source Retool alternatives.

### Retool's key features and use cases:

* Extensive Integration Capabilities: Retool supports a wide range of databases and APIs, such as SQL, Redis, and Airtable, making it a popular choice for developing Redis UIs, SQL GUIs, and Airtable admin panels.
    
* User Interface and Experience: Retool features a drag-and-drop interface, which enables users to build internal tools without extensive coding knowledge. The platform also provides a range of pre-built components, such as tables, forms, and charts, to speed up the development process.
