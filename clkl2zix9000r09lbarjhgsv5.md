## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building an Image Annotator

### Step 1: Sign Up and Create a New Project

Begin your journey by signing up on ILLA Cloud and creating a new project. Familiarize yourself with the platform's user-friendly interface, laying the foundation for your image annotator.

Create a new App in your builder and name it `Image Annotator`

### Step 2: Design the User Interface

Utilize ILLA Cloud's extensive React Component Library to craft an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for your image annotator. Customize the interface to suit your needs and create a seamless user experience.

Add an input component, switch its `Type` to `Search`, hide its label, and put `Search by URL` for `Placeholder`(optional) . Add a button component and labeled it as `Upload new image`(optional). Add a table component, an image component, a textarea component labeled as `Notes`, and three button components labeled as `Clear`, `Auto-generate` and `Save`. The overall layout can refer to the graph below.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-31.png align="left")

### Step 3: Configure Components

Since the Image Uploading feature is optional, we will skip the specific configuration of the filter and upload button here. If you want to know more, please refer to our [modal documentation](https://www.illacloud.com/docs/modal).

After we map the image dataset we want to annotate it into the `table` component, we want to show the image in the `image` component and its caption in the `textarea` component.

For the `image` component, we put `{{table1.selectedRow[0].image}}` for `Image Source`.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-32.png align="left")

For the `textarea` component, we put `{{table1.selectedRow[0].notes ==  '' || table1.selectedRow[0].notes ==  undefined ? '' : table1.selectedRow[0].notes}}` for `Default value` and `What is this image about? Type down your description or use the Auto-generate button for some idea` for `Placeholder`.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-35.png align="left")

### Step 4: Implement Manual Image Annotation

Incorporate manual image annotation tools into your image annotator. Empower users to manually add captions or annotations to images, providing a personal touch to the image understanding process.

For the `Clear` button, we want to click it to clear the texts in the input components.

1\. Click the \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Control components\`\*\* for action, choose `textarea` for components, and `clearValue` for Method.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-36.png align="left")

For the `Save` button, we want to click it to save the image caption in the textarea to database.

1\. Click the \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Trigger action\`\*\* for `action`, choose the data source action you set up for updating the database for `Action name`, and put `{{textarea1.value != undefined && textarea1.value != ''}}` for `Only run when`.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-38.png align="left")

### Step 5: Integrate Image Captioning Models

Explore the world of automatic image annotations by integrating image captioning models from Hugging Face. Utilize powerful AI to automatically generate captions for images, streamlining the annotation process and enhancing efficiency.

At the bottom of the page, Click `+ New` under the Action list. Select `Hugging Face Inference API` from the action list.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-27.png align="left")

Fill out the configuration of Hugging Face with your Hugging Face token with `read` access from [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens?ref=illa-blog).

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-28.png align="left")

After creating your Hugging Face action, copy the model name of the model you want to use from Hugging Face `Model ID` (here we use `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning`) and put the image as the input parameter into the model (ie `{{image1.imgSrc}}`)

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-29.png align="left")

For the `Auto-generate` button, we want to click it to generate an image caption with the hugging face API.

1\. Click the  \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Trigger action\`\*\* for the `action` and choose the hugging face API you want to trigger (ie `huggingface1`) for the `action name`

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-37.png align="left")

### Step 6: Testing and Refinement

Thoroughly test your image annotator to ensure seamless functionality. Gather user feedback and refine the interface by adding optional components, showing notifications when encountering an error, and customizing existing components as needed and annotation capabilities for a smooth user experience.

### Step 7: Deployment and Beyond

Once satisfied with your image annotator, deploy it to the world. Continue to explore ILLA Cloud's features and experiment with various AI models, unlocking the full potential of AI-driven image understanding applications.
