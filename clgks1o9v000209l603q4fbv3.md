Low-code development platforms are software tools that enable users to create applications with minimal or no coding. They typically provide drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built components, templates, and integrations with various data sources and APIs. Low-code platforms can help users save time, money, and resources by simplifying and accelerating the app development process.

However, not all low-code platforms are created equal. Some may offer more features, flexibility, and customization than others. Some may be more suitable for certain use cases, industries, or audiences than others. Some may have different pricing models, hosting options, or support levels than others.

In this blog post, we will compare two popular low-code platforms: Retool and Budibase. We will look at their features, cost, and user feedback to help you decide which one is the best fit for your needs. We will also introduce ILLA Cloud, a low-code internal tool development platform that offers a viable alternative to Retool and Budibase.
