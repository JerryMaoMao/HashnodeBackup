## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building Your AI Selfie Generator

Let's dive into the step-by-step process of building your personalized [AI selfie generator](https://blog.illacloud.com/crafting-a-personalized-ai-selfie-generator-using-illa-cloud/) with ILLA Cloud:

### Step 1: Sign Up and Log In

Begin by visiting the ILLA Cloud website and signing up for a free account. Once you've completed the registration process, log in to access the platform's extensive features.

### Step 2: Create a New Project

Click on the "Illa Builder" button to access, then click `+ Create New` to start building your AI selfie generator. Name your project `Selfie Generator` to kickstart your development process.

### Step 3: Customize Your User Interface

Use ILLA Cloud's drag-and-drop builder to customize your user interface. Add buttons, input fields, and image placeholders to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.

Add an input component, two button components labeled as `Clear` and `Generate`, and an image component. The overall layout can refer to the graph below.

### Step 4: Integrate Hugging Face's Selfie Generator Model

With ILLA Cloud's Hugging Face [integration](http://www.illacloud.com/integrations), integrating the selfie generator model is a breeze.

At the bottom of the page, Click `+ New` under the Action list. Select `Hugging Face Inference API` from the action list.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-48.png align="left")

Select an existing resource you used previously or fill out the configuration of Hugging Face with your Hugging Face token with `read` access from [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens?ref=illa-blog).

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-49.png align="left")

Browse through the list of available models and select the one that best suits your preferences and copy the model name of the model you want to use from Hugging Face `Model ID` (Here we use `2weaks/dreambooth-self-bg`). Put the input components value as the input parameter into the model (ie {{input1.value}})

### Step 5: Configure Component settings

Customize the component settings for your selfie generator.

For the `Clear` button, we want to click it to clear the texts in the input components.

1\. Click the \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Control components\`\*\* for action, choose `input1` for components, and `clearValue` for Method.

Similarly, we create multiple event handlers to clear the value for `Example Prompt` and `Style` radio group.

For the `Generate` button, we want to click it to generate a new image with the input sentence as the input parameter through the hugging face.

1\. Click the Â \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Trigger action\`\*\* for the `action` and choose the hugging face API you want to trigger for the `action name`

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-53.png align="left")

For the image component to display the output image from each hugging face model, we can put {{'data: image/jpeg;base64,'+[huggingface1.data](http://huggingface1.data)}} for `Image Source`.
