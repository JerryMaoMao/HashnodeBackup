## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building a Google Electra Generator with ILLA Cloud

### Step 1: Sign Up and Create a New Project

Begin your journey by signing up on ILLA Cloud's platform and creating a new project. Familiarize yourself with the user-friendly drag-and-drop builder, laying the foundation for your Google Electra generator.

Create a new App in your builder and name it `Google Electra Model`

### Step 2: Enable Hugging Face Integration

Within the project settings, activate Hugging Face integration to access an array of [AI](Unleashing Creativity: Building AI Anime Generators with ILLA Cloud) models, including Google Electra. Explore the world of AI and its potential in transforming your application.

Select `Hugging Face Inference API` from the action list.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-19.png align="left")

Fill out the configuration of Hugging Face with your Hugging Face token with `read` access from [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens?ref=illa-blog). Â

### Step 3: Design the User Interface

Utilize ILLA Cloud's extensive component library to design an engaging user interface for your Google Electra generator. Tailor the interface to meet your unique requirements and capture the essence of your application.

Add an input component labeled as `Initial Prompt`, a button component labeled as `Add to Example`(optional), two button components labeled as `Clear` and `Compute`, a select component labeled as `Example Prompt` with three items (optional), and a chart component. The overall layout can refer to the graph below.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-21.png align="left")

### Step 4: Integrate Google Electra AI

Incorporate Google Electra AI from Hugging Face into your ILLA Cloud project. Leverage the power of this advanced model to generate human-like responses, creating a dynamic and interactive experience for your users.

After creating your Hugging Face action, copy the model name of the model you want to use from Hugging Face `Model ID` (in this case, we want to use **google/electra-large-generator** )and put the value of the input component where users can input their prompt as a parameter to pass into the model. Here we use **{{input1.value}}**.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-22.png align="left")

### Step 5: Configuring the components

For the `Initial Prompt` input component, put "Please put down your question with the blank space to be \[MASK\]" in the `Placeholder`

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-23.png align="left")

For the `Generate` button, we want to click it to generate a new image with the input sentence as the input parameter through the hugging face.

1\. Click the Â \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Trigger action\`\*\* for the `action` and choose the hugging face API you want to trigger (ie huggingface1) for the `action name`

3\. In order to avoid passing in empty strings into the model, we put `{{input1.value != '' && input1.value != undefined}}` for `Only run when`.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-24.png align="left")

For the `Clear` button, we want to click it to clear the texts in the input components.

1\. Click the \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Control components\`\*\* for action, choose `input1` for components, and `clearValue` for Method.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-25.png align="left")

For the chart component to display the output score of the Electra model, we put `{{`[`huggingface1.data`](http://huggingface1.data)`}}` for the `Data Source`, `token_str` for `X-axis value`, and `score` to be the `Dataset values`.

![](https://blog.illacloud.com/content/images/2023/07/image-26.png align="left")

### Step 6: Testing and Refinement

Thoroughly test your Google Electra generator to ensure seamless functionality. Refine the AI integration and user interface by adding optional components, showing notifications when encountering an error, and customizing existing components as needed to deliver a smooth and engaging experience.
