The enterprise software industry is constantly evolving, driven by external factors, new technologies, and business needs. As a developer, you need to stay on top of the latest trends and best practices to deliver high-quality solutions that meet the expectations of your clients and users.

In this blog post, we will discuss nine enterprise software industry trends that will shape the way you build and deploy tools in 2023, and how you can adapt to them.

### The developer shortage isn’t going anywhere

The demand for software developers is expected to grow by 22% from 2019 to 2029, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, the supply of qualified developers is not keeping up with the demand, resulting in a talent gap that is hard to fill.  

To cope with this challenge, you need to leverage tools and platforms that can help you optimize your workflow, automate repetitive tasks, and collaborate with other developers. For example, you can use low-code or no-code platforms to quickly build prototypes or simple apps without any coding experience, or use code generation tools to speed up the development process.

### Economic shocks are impacting IT budgets

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the global economy, affecting the IT spending of many enterprises. [According to Gartner, global IT spending is expected to decline by 5.1% in 2020, and only recover by 2.3% in 2023](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685791/enterprise-software-services-sales-to-boost-2023-it-spending-by-2-3-gartner.html).

To survive in this uncertain environment, you need to focus on delivering value to your customers and users, while reducing costs and risks. You can do this by prioritizing the most important features and functionalities, using agile methodologies to deliver software faster and more efficiently, and choosing cloud-based solutions that offer scalability, security, and reliability.

### Demand for automation is still growing

Automation is not a new trend, but it is still one of the most important ones for enterprise software development. Automation can help you improve productivity, quality, and customer satisfaction, by eliminating human errors, reducing manual work, and enhancing user experience.

You can use automation tools and platforms to automate various aspects of your software development lifecycle, such as testing, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. You can also use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate complex tasks, such as data analysis, decision making, and personalization.

### Low code will gain even more traction

Low code is a software development approach that allows you to build applications using graphical user interfaces and pre-built components, instead of writing code from scratch. Low-code platforms can help you accelerate the development process, reduce the dependency on developers, and empower citizen developers to create their own solutions.

Low code is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years, as more enterprises adopt it to cope with the developer shortage, the need for automation, and the demand for digital transformation. [According to Forrester, the low-code market will grow from $13.2 billion in 2020 to $45.5 billion in 2025](https://www.hiddenbrains.com/blog/top-enterprise-software-development-trends.html).

One of the leading low-code platforms for developers is ILLA Cloud, an open-source platform that lets you build and deploy internal tools remarkably fast, without compromising on functionality or performance. You can use ILLA Cloud’s library of components and actions to connect to various data sources, such as databases, API/GraphQL endpoints, SaaS tools, and cloud storage services You can also choose how you want to host your tools, either using the ILLA Cloud service or the ILLA CLI.

### Progressive web apps will come to the fore

Progressive web apps (PWAs) are web applications that offer the look and feel of native apps but run on any device and browser. PWAs can provide many benefits, such as faster loading, offline access, push notifications, and home screen icons.

PWAs are expected to become more prevalent in 2023, as more enterprises realize their potential to reach and engage more users, especially in emerging markets where internet connectivity and device capabilities are limited. According to Statista, the global PWA market size will grow from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $10.4 billion in 2024.

You can use PWA frameworks and tools to create your own PWAs, such as React, Angular, Vue, Ionic, or Workbox. You can also use ILLA Cloud to build PW

### Containerization will become more prevalent

Containerization is another technologically-driven enterprise software industry trend that will come to the fore in 2023. This is a seachange in the way we develop and deploy tools. Containerization means bundling apps into isolated user spaces, while still sharing an OS.

Containerization can offer many advantages, such as faster deployment, easier scalability, better portability, and improved security. You can use containerization tools and platforms, such as Docker, Kubernetes, or OpenShift, to create and manage your containers.

### Cybersecurity will be a top priority

Cybersecurity is not a new trend, but it is still one of the most critical ones for enterprise software development. Cyberattacks are becoming more frequent, sophisticated, and damaging, posing a serious threat to the data, privacy, and reputation of enterprises and their customers.

You need to adopt a proactive and holistic approach to cybersecurity, by implementing best practices, such as encryption, authentication, authorization, and auditing. You also need to use cybersecurity tools and platforms, such as firewalls, antivirus, VPN, or SIEM, to protect your systems and networks from malicious actors.

### AI and ML will accelerate innovation

AI and ML are not new trends, but they are still one of the most influential ones for enterprise software development. AI and ML can help you automate complex tasks, such as data analysis, decision making, and personalization, as well as create new products and services, such as chatbots, voice assistants, or recommendation systems.

You can use AI and ML tools and platforms, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or AWS SageMaker, to build and deploy your AI and ML models. You can also use ILLA Cloud to integrate AI and ML services, such as Google Cloud Vision, Google Cloud Natural Language, or Amazon Comprehend, into your internal tools

### Microservices architecture will be in high demand

Microservices architecture is a software development approach that breaks down a large and complex application into smaller and independent services, each with its own functionality, data, and communication. Microservices architecture can offer many benefits, such as faster development, easier maintenance, better scalability, and higher reliability.

You can use microservices architecture tools and platforms, such as Spring Boot, Netflix Zuul, or Istio, to design and manage your microservices. You can also use ILLA Cloud to connect to your microservices, either using REST API or GraphQL endpoints.

## Conclusion

These are some of the top enterprise software industry trends that will shape the way you build and deploy tools in 2023. By adapting to these trends, you can stay ahead of the curve, deliver value to your customers and users, and grow your business.
