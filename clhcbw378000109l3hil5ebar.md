Low-code platforms are becoming increasingly popular among developers and businesses who want to build internal tools quickly and efficiently. Internal tools are applications that help teams perform specific tasks, such as dashboards, admin panels, customer support tools, approval apps, and more. However, building internal tools from scratch can be time-consuming, costly, and complex, especially when dealing with multiple data sources and APIs.

Thatâ€™s where low-code platforms come in. Low-code platforms provide a visual and intuitive way to create internal tools without writing a lot of code. They typically offer drag-and-drop UI components, pre-built templates, connectors to various data sources and APIs, and the ability to customize and extend functionality with code. By using low-code platforms, developers can save time and resources, focus on business logic and user experience, and deliver internal tools faster and easier.

In this blog post, we will compare two low-code platforms that are designed for building internal tools: Appsmith and ILLA Cloud. We will look at their features, benefits, drawbacks, pricing, and use cases, and help you decide which one is better suited for your needs.

## What is Appsmith?

Appsmith is an open-source low-code platform that helps developers build and deploy internal tools 10x faster. Appsmith allows developers to easily connect to popular databases and APIs, quickly build UI with ready React-powered widgets, customize and extend functionality with code, and deploy reliably and securely[(1)](https://www.appsmith.com/).

Some of the key features of Appsmith are:

* **UI Builder**: Appsmith provides a drag-and-drop UI builder that lets developers create beautiful and responsive UIs with 45+ ready widgets, such as tables, charts, lists, modals, forms, and more. [Developers can also customize the UI with theming and branding options](https://www.appsmith.com/).
    
* [**Data Sources: Appsmith supports connecting to various data sources, such as SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.), NoSQL databases (Firestore), cloud storage services (Amazon S3), SaaS providers (Google Sheets, Airtable), or any GraphQL/REST API**](https://www.appsmith.com/). Appsmith also supports database- and API-native operations to test connections and prepare data for the UI.
    
* **JavaScript Support**: Appsmith allows developers to write JavaScript code anywhere in the platform to add logic, manipulate data, and define workflows. [Developers can use built-in JavaScript libraries or import external libraries to enhance their applications](https://www.appsmith.com/).
    
* **Deployment Options**: Appsmith offers two deployment options: Appsmith Cloud and self-hosting. [Appsmith Cloud is a free hosted service that lets developers start building their apps on any device without any installation or configuration](https://www.appsmith.com/). [Self-hosting is a free option that lets developers host Appsmith on their own servers or cloud providers for more control and security](https://www.appsmith.com/).
    

## What is ILLA Cloud?

ILLA Cloud is a low-code platform that helps developers accelerate their internal tools development. [ILLA Cloud enables developers to connect to any data source or API, build UI with drag-and-drop components, write JavaScript code to extend functionality, and collaborate with other developers in real-time](https://www.illacloud.com/).

Some of the key features of ILLA Cloud are:

* [**SQL Generate: ILLA Cloud provides a SQL Generate feature that lets developers input natural language and get SQL statements that can be run directly on databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Supabase, etc**](https://www.illacloud.com/). This helps developers save time and avoid syntax errors when writing SQL queries.
    
* **JavaScript Support**: ILLA Cloud offers developers a high degree of freedom to implement richer functionality through JavaScript. [Developers can write inline JavaScript or reusable code blocks in an IDE-like editor with autocomplete, multi-line editing, debugging, and linting features](https://www.illacloud.com/). [Developers can also use template syntax to bind data or add logic in widget props](https://www.illacloud.com/).
    
* [**Data Sources: ILLA Cloud supports connecting to various data sources such as databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.), API/GraphQL endpoints (Stripe, Google Sheets, Twilio, etc.), or any data connected through APIs**](https://www.illacloud.com/). [ILLA Cloud also provides a JS Transformer feature that lets developers transform data from different sources using JavaScript](https://www.illacloud.com/).
    
* **Real-Time Collaboration**: ILLA Cloud enables developers to work simultaneously in ILLA Builder by sharing links. Developers can co-edit and communicate with others in real time to give timely feedback and improve development efficiency.
    
* **UI Library**: ILLA Cloud provides a fully responsive UI library with dozens of components that meet the needs of different scenarios. Developers can drag and drop components such as tables, charts, forms, modals, and more to boost their productivity.
    
* **Deployment Options**: ILLA Cloud offers two deployment options: ILLA Cloud and self-hosting. ILLA Cloud is a one-click deployment service that lets developers enjoy the easiest deployment experience without any installation or configuration. [Self-hosting is a free option that lets developers host ILLA on their own servers or cloud providers using ILLA CLI, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes for better security and performance](https://www.illacloud.com/).
    

## How do they compare?

Both Appsmith and ILLA Cloud are low-code platforms that aim to help developers build internal tools faster and easier. They have some similarities in terms of features, such as:

* They both provide drag-and-drop UI builders with various widgets and components.
    
* They both support connecting to multiple data sources and APIs and running queries and operations on them.
    
* They both allow writing JavaScript code to add logic and customize functionality.
    
* They both offer cloud and self-hosting deployment options.
    

However, they also have some differences that make them suitable for different use cases and preferences. Some of the main differences are:

* Appsmith is open-source and free to use for both cloud and self-hosting options, while ILLA Cloud has a freemium pricing model for its cloud service and a free option for self-hosting.
    
* Appsmith supports more data sources and APIs than ILLA Cloud, including NoSQL databases like Firestore and cloud storage services like Amazon S3.
    
* Appsmith provides more UI customization options than ILLA Cloud, such as theming and branding.
    
* ILLA Cloud has a SQL Generate feature that lets developers write SQL queries using natural language, which Appsmith does not have.
    
* ILLA Cloud has a real-time collaboration feature that lets developers work together on the same app, which Appsmith does not have.
    
* ILLA Cloud has a JS Transformer feature that lets developers transform data from different sources using JavaScript, which Appsmith does not have.
    

### Pricing

Another important factor to consider when choosing a low-code platform is the pricing. Appsmith and ILLA Cloud have different pricing models that may suit different budgets and needs.

Appsmith is completely free and open-source, regardless of whether you use their cloud service or self-host it on your own servers or cloud providers. [You can use Appsmith to build unlimited apps with unlimited users, data sources, widgets, and custom code](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing). However, Appsmith does not offer any premium features or support plans for enterprise customers.

ILLA Cloud has a freemium pricing model for its cloud service, which means you can use it for free up to a certain limit, and then pay for additional usage or features. [The free plan allows you to build apps with one team member, all components, all resources, and basic security and support](https://www.illa.cloud/pricing). [The paid plans start from $10 per user per month and offer more team members, apps, resources, security, support, and collaboration features](https://www.illa.cloud/pricing). [ILLA Cloud also offers a free option for self-hosting, which gives you more control and security over your data and deployment](https://www.trustradius.com/products/appsmith/pricing).
