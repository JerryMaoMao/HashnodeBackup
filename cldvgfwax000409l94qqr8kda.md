The world of open-source tools is progressing at lightning speed. We can see the developers generating innovative ideas and new internal tools development platforms open for other programmers to customize for their use. We can see OSS (Open-source software) replacing many old big players in the development and internal tools market. We have Adobe Workfront alternatives, Mavenlink alternatives, virtual event platforms, and many other tools related to every field.

Many promising open-source projects are evolving and proving to support the developer fraternity, such as low-code open-source development environments. Most of the OSS don't need a software license for personal use, but they may charge for business use.

Let us move on and see the fast-growing open-source projects in 2022, how you can incorporate them into your workspace, and how you can contribute to these open-source projects.[**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/top-10-fast-growing-open-source#1-illa)

ILLA is an open source low-code platform for developers. It is a comprehensive development platform with APIs to integrate design, interactions, SaaS, and databases. It supports the developers in integrating the data fetched from the database to the frontend components. These APIs make the overall development and programming very convenient because the programmer can simply call the function to achieve the backend tasks.

ILLA is becoming the most preferred development environment for beginners and experts alike because of the easy learning curve. It has simple API calls and drag-and-drop design elements that help the developers to focus more on the business logic.

### **Product Features**

#### **Responsive UI library**

ILLA follows the latest web standards and offers an extensive library of responsive design. You can create custom themes and application templates with responsive touch-based/click-based user interfaces. There is much room for customization for forms, buttons, colors, navigation bars, etc. Integration with JavaScript code is also possible.

#### **Real-Time Collaboration**

Real-time collaboration in ILLA builder is done through sharing of links between the developers. They can edit the same code together and communicate the changes to others in real-time. So, it saves both time and effort for the team.[**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/top-10-fast-growing-open-source#api-and-database-integration)

#### **API & Database Integration**

You can integrate third-party APIs, databases, and other tools to design a fully functional application using the method calls in the ILLA code. The developer has more freedom and functionality using very less code. Hence, they can focus more on their business logic.[**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/top-10-fast-growing-open-source#easy-deployment-and-automation)
