CRUD apps are everywhere. If you've ever built an app that allows users to create, read, update, or delete data, then you've made a CRUD app.

This post will show you how to quickly use ILLA to build a CRUD app. We'll also provide some tips on what to consider when building your own CRUD app. Let's get started!

## **What is CRUD app**

A CRUD app stands for 'Create, Read, Update and Delete,' It is a user interface that informs your database of what functions to perform. It is a type of database management system where each representation within the user interface typically represents an attribute in the underlying data structure.

These four actions represent the most basic operations of a persistent storage system, which are meant to staff and keep track of existing employees. A user can create objects on a web application designed to perform four basic CRUD operations; Create, Retrieve/Read, Update, and Delete. Usually, when building a CRUD app, you usually interact with databases containing tables containing data that businesses and organizations use to maintain their day-to-day workflows.

The user’s interaction with the web application is recorded in the SQL database as part of the CRUD process. Building a simple CRUD app will teach users how to create entities from scratch and use objects from libraries like React.

With this understanding, users will know how all entities interact using REST API for accessing or sending data back and forth between client-side applications and server-side applications written in a programming language such as NodeJS or Python. The knowledge acquired from building a simple CRUD app allows businesses and organizations an easy way to maintain information such as staff records more efficiently.

## **Examples of popular CRUD apps**

There are many popular CRUD apps that user interface (UI) designers use to manage databases. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations that are so commonly used in web applications. These applications usually consist of parts where users can create new or modify the existing data using the CRUD functions.

For example, a simple CRUD app could be used by staff to keep track of existing employees and their information. Popular low-code platforms such as Retool, Appsmith, and Tooljet offer user-friendly environments to quickly develop custom CRUD applications for both desktop-oriented and mobile users. Together, these apps make it easy for businesses to set up complex user management systems without requiring much front-end development work.

## **Introduce ILLA and how it can be used to build a CRUD app**

ILLA is an open-source low-code platform for building internal tools. Its main aim is to help programmers develop modules to monitor data, which is one of the most tedious jobs for a developer. Another new feature in this open-source low-code app is that you can make your own customized block of code and then later put it up for sale in the marketplace.

It gets connected to the mainstream database, or it can connect to any database through APIs. It can even add action to the chain of user events. Its backend and front-end data components are tightly integrated; hence developers can write data calls for massive information interaction.

It is doubly helpful for developers because it offers them the freedom to implement richer functionality. They can use {{template syntax}} for richer content.

It allows real-time collaboration, making it easier for developers to interact at different ends of the world to work on it simultaneously. They can use ILLA Builder by sharing links, co-editing, and communicating for improved development efficiency.

ILLA Builder has a comprehensive UI library. It has several valuable components that developers can use to drop and drag to build attractive interfaces without wasting much time

Features:

* It can easily be integrated with any database.
    
* You can download ILLA CLI for any of these operating systems: Windows, Linux, and MAC.
    
* It offers real-time collaboration, enabling developers to communicate for better development.
    
* It provides flexible deployment. You can use ILLA Cloud, ILLA CLI, Kubernetes, and Docker.
    
* You can easily integrate third-party APIs.
    
* It is free to share, use, copy, and update.
    
* It is constantly being polished with new updates and features.
    

ILLA Cloud provides businesses and organizations with a powerful CRUD APP that can be used to manage data resources and provide a user interface for manipulating them. It is built using popular React open-source libraries, allowing developers to create sophisticated CRUD apps from scratch. Its Rest API calls allow businesses with access rights within their organization to easily interact with the web application and keep track of employee records and other essential data.

In addition, ILLA Cloud is a low-code developer tool, Retool alternatives, which provides user-friendly environments for quickly developing custom CRUD applications. These tools enable organizations to quickly set up complex user management systems without extensive front-end development work.

Furthermore, leveraging a database management system like PostgreSQL or MongoDB allows developers to efficiently access data resources through the ILLA Cloud's CRUD app they build. The low code platforms also make it easier for developers to create custom CRUD apps that are both desktop and mobile compatible with minimal effort on their part.
