Low-code development platforms (LCDPs) are software tools that enable developers to create applications with minimal coding. They offer features such as drag-and-drop interfaces, visual editors, pre-built components, data connectors, and code generators that simplify and speed up the development process.

LCDPs are especially useful for building internal tools, such as dashboards, admin panels, workflows, and CRUD apps. Internal tools are applications that help businesses manage their data, processes, and operations more efficiently. However, building internal tools from scratch can be time-consuming, costly, and complex.

That’s why many developers turn to LCDPs to build internal tools faster and easier. LCDPs can help developers save time and money, reduce errors and bugs, improve productivity and collaboration, and deliver better user experiences.

However, not all LCDPs are created equal. There are many factors to consider when choosing an LCDP for your internal tool development needs, such as:

* Features and Functionality
    
* Ease of use and learning curve
    
* Customization and flexibility
    
* Integration and compatibility
    
* Pricing and support
    

In this blog post, we will compare two popular LCDPs for building internal tools: Appsmith and Tooljet. We will also introduce ILLA Cloud, a new and innovative LCDP that offers a viable alternative to Appsmith and Tooljet.

## What is Appsmith?

Appsmith is an open-source LCDP that enables developers to build admin panels, internal tools, and dashboards. It integrates with 15+ databases and any API and offers a framework to build custom widgets and plugins.

Appsmith’s main features include:

* A drag-and-drop UI builder with 45+ pre-built widgets
    
* A query editor to write SQL or JavaScript queries to interact with data sources
    
* A code editor to write custom logic using JavaScript
    
* A debugger to test and troubleshoot queries and code
    
* A version control system to manage changes and deployments
    
* A user management system to define roles and permissions
    
* A self-hosting option to deploy on any cloud or on-premise server
    

## What is Tooljet?

Tooljet is an extensible LCDP that enables developers to build business applications. It connects to databases, cloud storage, GraphQL, API endpoints, Airtable, etc., and offers a drag-and-drop application builder.

Tooljet’s main features include the following:
