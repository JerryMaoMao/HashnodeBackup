Low-code platforms are software tools that allow users to create applications without writing much code. They provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that lets users drag and drop components, connect data sources, and configure logic and functionality. Low-code platforms can help developers save time and resources, as well as enable non-developers to create their own internal tools.

In this blog post, we will compare two popular low-code platforms: Retool and ILLA Cloud. We will look at their features, pros and cons, pricing, and user feedback. We will also introduce you to ILLA Cloud, a new low-code platform that offers a viable alternative to Retool.
