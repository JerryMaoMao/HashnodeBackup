ChatGPT is a powerful chatbot that uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user input in a personalized and human-like way. With its ability to understand and respond to user input in multiple forms, including text, voice, and even images and videos, ChatGPT provides a convenient and intuitive way to interact with a computer or device.

Additionally, ChatGPT’s ability to maintain context across multiple conversations allows users to have more natural and engaging interactions, and its ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously makes it a valuable tool for multitasking and productivity.

Furthermore, ChatGPT can be customized and trained to specific domains and tasks, enabling it to provide more personalized and relevant responses to user queries. All these features and capabilities make ChatGPT a popular choice among users who want to enhance their user experience and make their interactions with computers and devices more efficient and effective.

## **Relationship between ChatpGPT and GPT-3**

ChatGPT is a smaller variant of OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) model. Both models are based on the Transformer architecture and are pre-trained on large amounts of text data to generate human-like text.

However, GPT-3 is a much larger and more powerful model compared to ChatGPT, with 175 billion parameters. It is capable of performing a wider range of tasks such as language translation, summarization, and question answering, among others.

On the other hand, ChatGPT is a smaller and more focused model optimized for conversational AI tasks, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. It is designed to generate natural language responses to user inputs in real time, making it a good choice for conversational AI applications.

In summary, GPT-3 is a more general-purpose language model, while ChatGPT is specialized for conversational AI.

## [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/discover-the-power-of-chatgpt#rest-api)**REST API**

A REST API is a web-based service that uses the REST architectural style to provide access to data and functionality from other applications or services. It provides a standardized and flexible way to access and interact with web-based services and applications. ILLA has a REST API action built in. This means that developers can easily integrate these services and applications with the tools they build in ILLA, and users can access and use the data and functionality provided by the REST API consistently and predictably.

Using ChatGPT as a chatbot for ILLA’s users was my first impression. However, ChatGPT is a large and powerful language processing model with many potential uses beyond chatbots. Some of the other potential applications of ChatGPT include:

* Language translation: ChatGPT has the potential to improve the performance of machine translation systems, making them more accurate and natural-sounding.
    
* Summarization: ChatGPT could automatically summarize long pieces of text, such as news articles or research papers.
    
* Text generation: ChatGPT could generate creative and interesting text, such as poetry, fiction, or even music lyrics.
    
* Question answering: ChatGPT could be used to answer a wide range of questions, from simple factual questions to more complex ones requiring common sense knowledge.
    
* Sentiment analysis: ChatGPT could automatically analyze text sentiment, such as whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral.
    
* Text classification: ChatGPT could automatically classify text into different categories, such as spam, fake news, or sensitive content.
    
* Code Generator: ChatGPT could use natural language to create simple SQL queries. It can also do it in a reverse way, translating the code into a natural language for users to understand the code.

We use the REST API in ILLA to build out a feature to generate text based on our command. This can help our users to save time on copywriting and other heavy-texting work. As you can see, the quality of the copywriting in the tips is beyond good. All you need is to describe the text you want and ChatGPT will generate such a paragraph for you.

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/discover-the-power-of-chatgpt#create-a-rest-api-resource-to-connect-to-open-ai)**Create a REST API Resource to connect to OpenAI**

Enter the **app editor** &gt; click **+New** in Action List &gt; select **REST API** &gt; click + **New Resource** &gt; enter the connection information and name it **OpenAI**.

![​Create a REST API Resource to connect to OpenAI](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1675758344098/f0834e03-26b4-492c-bbe0-cb90ce1fb3d0.png align="center")

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/discover-the-power-of-chatgpt#query-the-rest-api)**Query the REST API**

After creating the resource named OpenAI, **create an action** with it and name the action **OpenAIConnection** &gt; change the **action type** to **POST** &gt; edit the **Body** &gt; **Save** the action

![Query the REST API](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1675758357899/7b660af5-38a4-4a94-80b7-321461c83625.png align="center")

The body is as follows:

```plaintext
{{
{

"model": "text-davinci-003",

"prompt": "Write a creative ad for the following product to run on facebook aimed at "+ input1.value +":\n\nProduct: " + input2.value,

"max_tokens": 100,

"top_p": 1.0,

"frequency_penalty": 0.0,

"presence_penalty": 0.0

}

}}
```

Add two input components to enter the product information. We have called the data in **OpenAIConnection** via **input1.value** and **input2.value**

## **ChatGPT and AIGC**

ChatGPT and AIGC are both state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that leverage machine learning and deep learning to solve complex problems. These technologies are based on neural networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

Through training on massive amounts of data, CHATGPT and AIGC have learned to perform tasks such as natural language processing and computer vision, among others. The result is AI systems that can perform tasks with accuracy and efficiency that approaches or even surpasses human intelligence. This breakthrough in AI development has been a long-standing goal in computer science, often portrayed in science fiction as the next frontier of technology. However, the reality of these AI technologies is rapidly catching up to the fiction, with access to powerful models like GPT-3 providing the capability to perform a wide range of tasks with remarkable precision.

While AI technologies can perform many tasks without human intervention, there are still some tasks that require human expertise, such as image recognition and computer vision. Nevertheless, the impact of CHATGPT and AIGC on problem-solving is already substantial, and the potential for further development is immense.

## [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/discover-the-power-of-chatgpt#conclusion)**Conclusion**

In conclusion, ChatGPT is a powerful and versatile language processing model that has the potential to significantly improve the performance of many different types of natural language processing applications. Its impressive size and capabilities make it well-suited for use in many applications, including chatbots.

The use of ChatGPT in ILLA can provide many benefits, such as generating more natural and varied responses and handling a wider range of questions and topics.
