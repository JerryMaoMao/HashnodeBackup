Low-code development platforms are tools that enable users to create applications without writing much code. They typically offer a visual interface, drag-and-drop components, pre-built templates, and easy integrations with databases and APIs. Low-code development platforms can help users save time, reduce costs, and improve productivity.

However, not all low-code development platforms are the same. Some are more suitable for certain use cases, audiences, and budgets than others. In this blog post, we will compare two popular low-code development platforms: Appsmith and DronaHQ. We will also introduce ILLA Cloud, a new low-code internal tool development platform that offers a viable alternative to both Appsmith and DronaHQ.

## What is Appsmith?

Appsmith is an open-source tool that enables developers to quickly build custom internal tools. It allows users to connect to any database or API, create UI components using widgets, and write custom logic using JavaScript. Appsmith can be used to build dashboards, admin panels, CRUD apps, workflows, and more.

Appsmith offers a free plan that includes unlimited users, apps, datasources, and widgets. It also has a cloud plan that starts at $20 per month and provides features such as authentication, user management, audit logs, and support. Users can also deploy Appsmith on their own servers using Docker or Kubernetes.

## What is DronaHQ?

DronaHQ is a low-code toolkit that helps developers quickly build internal tools using a drag-and-drop UI builder. It allows users to connect apps to any database or API, create forms and tables using components, and add rules and validations using a visual rule engine. DronaHQ can be used to build web or mobile apps for HR, operations, finance, engineering, and more.

DronaHQ offers a free plan that includes 200 app users per month and 1 GB of storage. It also has paid plans that start at $10 per month and provide features such as unlimited apps, workflows, automations, PDF creator, user roles, analytics, and support. Users can also deploy DronaHQ on their own servers using Docker.

## How do Appsmith and DronaHQ compare?

Appsmith and DronaHQ have some similarities and differences in terms of their features, capabilities, and pricing. Here is a table that summarizes some of the key aspects of each platform:

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Feature</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Appsmith</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>DronaHQ</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Open source</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Free plan</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Cloud plan</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Starts at $20/mo</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Starts at $10/mo</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>On-prem deployment</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>UI builder</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Widgets</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Components</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Database connectors</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>22</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>26</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>API connectors</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Visual action builder</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Visual rule engine</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Responsive design</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Form repeat</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Dynamic tab creation</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Multi-level side menu</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Sub apps</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Workflow builder</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Automation builder</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>PDF creator</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

As you can see from the table above, Appsmith and DronaHQ have different strengths and weaknesses. Appsmith is more developer-friendly and open-source, while DronaHQ is more user-friendly and feature-rich. Depending on your needs and preferences, you may choose one over the other.

However, what if you are looking for a platform that combines the best of both worlds? A platform that is easy to use yet powerful enough to handle complex use cases? A platform that is affordable yet offers premium features? A platform that is new yet reliable enough to trust?
