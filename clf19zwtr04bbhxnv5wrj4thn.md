As companies grow larger, the issue of developers spending significant amounts of time building internal tools becomes more pronounced. Surprisingly, for companies with over 5,000 employees, developers spend 45% of their time working on internal tools. This seems counterproductive since the purpose of internal tools is to enhance productivity. It begs the question, **why are developers spending so much time on internal tools?**

## Internal tools are primarily developed from scratch by developers.

Retool conducted a survey of 650 developers and found that approximately two-thirds of developers prefer to construct fully customized applications from scratch. This finding may not come as a surprise, since building applications from scratch allows developers to have complete control over the final product.

In terms of programming languages, the most commonly used languages include JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, TypeScript, and Python. The survey also revealed that the most popular frameworks used by developers are React, Express, jQuery (which is somewhat surprising), Angular, and Vue.js.

From a logical standpoint, it makes sense to use the most popular frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js for building both internal tools and company products. Using these popular frameworks enables companies to benefit from the vast community support available and helps developers to be more efficient in their work.

Despite my surprise, jQuery's high ranking could be attributed to older companies with 15-year-old codebases that have not yet incorporated newer frameworks. These companies may be more comfortable using a familiar technology that has been tried and tested over time rather than adopting newer and less-established frameworks.

## What is the reason behind developers' reluctance to use low-code development?

Developers have a reputation for being fiercely independent and self-sufficient. They take pride in their ability to build complex applications from scratch, often using intricate code that only they can fully understand. This sense of pride and ownership is a significant factor that prevents many developers from embracing low code tools.

The notion of using a pre-built tool that automates parts of the development process is often viewed as a sign of weakness or a lack of skill. Developers who have spent years honing their craft may feel that using low code tools diminishes the value of their expertise, and they may worry that their colleagues or clients will view them as less capable or skilled.

Another reason why developers may choose pride over speed is the fear of losing control. Many developers relish the challenge of building complex applications from scratch and enjoy the sense of control that comes with knowing every line of code. They may be hesitant to relinquish control to a low code tool that automates parts of the development process, fearing that they may lose control over the final product.

Ultimately, it is essential for developers to recognize that low code tools can complement their skills and allow them to work more efficiently. While there may be some resistance to adopting these tools due to pride, the benefits of increased speed, reduced workload, and improved collaboration cannot be ignored. By being open-minded and willing to learn, developers can leverage low code tools to enhance their skills and deliver high-quality applications in less time.

## Using Existing Service

Nowadays, the use of bundlers and automatic deployment upon pushing to GitHub has simplified the process. With the emergence of low-code app building, the development process has become even more straightforward and efficient.

Utilizing low-code development is similar to using an established service such as Stripe, as it can save a significant amount of time on infrastructure development. Choosing an existing payment processing service like Stripe also results in lower development costs in comparison to building a payment system from scratch. Stripe offers a user-friendly, pre-built payment processing solution that eliminates the need to create and maintain a custom payment system.

Creating a payment system from the ground up necessitates a substantial development effort, including the development and integration of the payment gateway, security measures, and compliance with industry regulations. Additionally, maintaining a custom-built payment system regularly can be a daunting task to ensure its continued security and functionality.

In contrast, Stripe offers a dependable, secure payment processing solution that can be quickly integrated into websites and applications. Stripe handles managing the payment gateway, implementing necessary security measures, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations. Additionally, developers can leverage Stripe's extensive documentation and support resources, saving time and effort during the development process.

## How much time can be saved if using low code?

Let's say A developer needs to develop a dashboard for the marketing team. Based on industry standards and experience, creating a basic dashboard with a limited set of features can take around 60-100 hours of development time. This estimate includes tasks such as designing the user interface, defining the data sources, implementing data visualization, and setting up basic security measures.

In general, low-code development platforms offer pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality, which simplifies the dashboard creation process. This can reduce the development time significantly, allowing developers to focus on customizing the dashboard's look and feel or integrating it with other systems.

According to a study by Forrester Consulting, low-code development platforms can reduce the time required to develop an application by an average of 50-80%. In terms of creating a dashboard, low-code development platforms can help developers create a basic dashboard within a few hours, while a custom-built dashboard can take weeks or even months to develop. As of September 2021, the average base salary for a software developer in the San Francisco Bay Area is around $126,000 per year. If the company uses low code to develop such a dashboard, it can save at least 5k.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, utilizing low code development platforms can be a game-changer for developers, saving them a significant amount of time without affecting their sense of pride in their work. Rather than spending hours developing basic infrastructure from scratch, developers can focus on creating products with significant meaning that can enhance their skillset and create value for their organization. By staying up-to-date with the latest technology, developers can ensure that they remain efficient and competitive in their work. Furthermore, low code development is here to stay and is likely to become more prevalent as more people adopt it, leading to the development of better products and more efficient development processes. As such, developers can embrace low code development with confidence, knowing that it can enhance their productivity and help them create more impactful products.
