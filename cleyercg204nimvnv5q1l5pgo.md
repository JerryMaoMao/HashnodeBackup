Software development is constantly evolving, with new technologies and tools emerging every day. One of the most significant recent innovations in this field is low code development, which offers a faster, more efficient way to build software applications. At ILLA Cloud, we are proud to be a part of this exciting new trend, providing developers with low-code tools to help them work more efficiently. In this blog post, we will explore the impact of low code on the future of software development, including how it can reduce internal tool development time, lower costs, and benefit both startups and enterprises.

## What is Low-code development?

Low code development is a software development approach that uses visual interfaces and declarative programming to enable developers to create applications quickly and easily, with minimal coding. Instead of traditional programming, low code platforms use drag-and-drop components and pre-built templates to create applications. This approach simplifies the development process, allowing businesses to build applications in less time and with fewer resources. Low code development democratizes app development, making it accessible to a wider range of people, including those with no coding experience. As a result, low code is rapidly becoming a popular choice for companies looking to streamline their development processes and improve time-to-market.

## Low Code will impact the future of software development

Low code development is rapidly gaining popularity among businesses of all sizes due to its potential to significantly impact the future of software development. With the ability to reduce internal tool development time, lower costs, and increase efficiency, low code platforms are becoming a viable alternative to traditional coding methods. Additionally, the impact of low code on startups and enterprises alike cannot be ignored, as it provides a means for businesses to achieve startup speed by connecting and automating legacy systems. As a result, low code development has the potential to reshape the software development industry and streamline the process of creating custom applications.

### Low code can reduce internal tool development time

Internal tools play a crucial role in organizations, allowing teams to work more efficiently and effectively. However, developing these tools can be a significant drain on developers' time and resources. According to a survey by ILLA Cloud, developers spend nearly a third of their time building internal applications. This is not an ideal use of their time, as internal tools are profoundly impactful, but it is not necessarily how developers or their organizations want to spend their time.

Low code platforms can help to alleviate the time-consuming nature of internal tool development. These platforms provide pre-built components and templates, making it easier for developers to create applications with minimal coding required. With low code platforms, developers can build internal tools faster, enable non-developers to build them, democratize data across the organization, and protect their stack from "shadow IT" that inevitably creeps in when developers can't fulfill all internal tool requests timely.

#### Example

Organizations that have embraced low code development have seen success in reducing internal tool development time. For instance, A drink Bottlers, leveraged low code platforms to develop an internal tool that tracks sales and inventory data. Using low code tools, the company was able to develop the tool in just two months, reducing development time by 75%. Similarly, Cimpress, a printing company, was able to develop an internal tool for its marketing team using low-code platforms. The tool allowed the marketing team to track campaign performance and make data-driven decisions. By using low-code tools, the company was able to develop the tool in just four weeks, reducing development time by 50%.

### Low code will expand the circle of software development

The traditional software development process requires skilled developers to write lines of code from scratch, making it a time-consuming and costly process. However, with the advent of low code development, the circle of software development is expanding beyond just the traditional software developers. Low code development platforms provide drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built templates, and other visual tools that allow non-technical staff to create applications. This means that more people can now contribute to software development, reducing the workload on skilled developers and expanding the pool of people who can develop applications.

Low code development also reduces costs for companies by allowing them to hire fewer developers. With low code, businesses can move more developers from internal tool development to customer-facing product development, allowing companies to scale faster while reducing development costs. Furthermore, low-code platforms can be used by citizen developers, such as business analysts or operations staff, who may not have formal coding training but can use these platforms to create their own applications. This opens up software development opportunities to a wider range of people, which can lead to increased innovation and productivity within organizations.

#### Example

For example, a construction company could use a low-code platform to create an application that helps project managers to track construction progress. With low code development, project managers can develop the application themselves without relying on the IT department, saving time and reducing costs. This approach allows more people within the organization to contribute to the development of the application, leading to a more collaborative and efficient process.

## The impact of low code on startups and enterprises

Startups and enterprises often face significant challenges in software development. For startups, the focus is on quickly delivering an MVP and getting feedback from users to iterate and improve the product. Enterprises, on the other hand, often have to deal with legacy technology and systems that can slow down development and impede innovation.

Low code development has the potential to overcome these challenges by enabling faster development and improving collaboration among teams. With low code platforms, startups can reduce the time and resources spent on internal tools and instead focus on building customer-facing products that can drive growth. Back-end developers can also do more with low code, as they can quickly spin up intuitive user interfaces to present data to users without needing front-end development expertise.

Moreover, low code can help startups achieve product-market fit sooner in their lifecycle. By quickly creating and testing MVPs, startups can get valuable feedback from users and iterate on their product until it meets market needs. This is particularly valuable in today's fast-paced business environment, where time-to-market is critical for success.

For enterprises, low code can help modernize their technology stack by connecting legacy systems and technology to new applications and services. This can reduce the costs associated with maintaining and upgrading legacy systems, while also enabling greater flexibility and agility in the face of changing business needs. With low code, enterprises can also achieve digital transformation by automating key business processes and improving the customer experience through faster delivery of new products and services.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, low code development is a game-changer for software development. It has the potential to significantly reduce development time, reduce costs, and increase efficiency, making it an attractive option for startups and enterprises alike. While some may be skeptical of the hype around low code, the latest research shows that the vast majority of developers find it useful and plan to keep using it. With Gartner predicting that the majority of application development activity will come from low-code platforms in just a few years, it's clear that this technology is here to stay. By empowering developers to focus on the most important software development problems, low code is poised to shape the future of software development in ways that we can't even imagine.
