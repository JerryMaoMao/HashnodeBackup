## Creating a Random Pokemon Generator with Stable Diffusion and ILLA Cloud

### Step 1: Sign Up and Create a New Project

Visit ILLA Cloud's website, sign up, and create a new project to embark on your creative journey. Familiarize yourself with the [drag-and-drop](https://blog.illacloud.com/updated-drag-and-drop-feature-of-illa-cloud-revolutionizing-component-placement-and-layout/) builder and React Component Library for an efficient development process.

Create a new App in your builder and name it `Pokemon Generator`

### Step 2: Add Components to the canvas.

Add an input component, a button component labeled as `Generate`, a radio group labeled as `Prompt history` with three items (optional), an image component, and a button component labeled as `Download`(optional). The overall layout can refer to the graph below.

### Step 3: Accessing Hugging Face Integration

Enable Hugging Face integration within your project settings to gain access to a multitude of powerful AI models, including furry diffusion AI.

Select `Hugging Face Inference API` from the action list.

Fill out the configuration of Hugging face with your Hugging face token with `read` access from [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

After created your Hugging face action, copy the model name of the model you want to use from Hugging face for `Model ID` and put the value of the input component where users can input their prompt as a parameter to pass into the model. Here we use {{input1.value}}.

### Step 4: Configuring the components to trigger action

For the `Generate` button, we want it to generate new image with the input component sentence as input parameter through hugging face.

1\. Click the \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Trigger action\`\*\* for action and choose `huggingface1` for action name

### Step 5: Configure the image component

In order to display the output image of the hugging face generated image, we put {{'data:img/jpeg;base64,'+[huggingface1.data](http://huggingface1.data)}} into the Image source of  the image component.
