In today's fast-paced digital landscape, organizations are seeking efficient ways to develop and deploy applications quickly. Open-source low-code tools have emerged as game-changers, enabling developers to build applications with minimal coding efforts. In this blog, we'll dive into the realm of LCDP (Low-code Development Platform) as well as awesome self-hosted open-source low-code tools, exploring the awe-inspiring capabilities of Budibase, Appsmith, ILLA Cloud, and Tooljet. Additionally, we'll discuss alternative options like Retool, which may not be open source but can still be self-hosted. Let's discover the possibilities and find the ideal tool for your development needs.

## Self-Hosted Open-Source Low-Code Tools

Self-hosted open-source low-code refers to a software development approach where organizations have the freedom to host and manage their low-code platform on their own infrastructure. It combines the benefits of open-source software, which provides access to the source code and encourages community contributions, with the convenience and efficiency of low-code development, which allows for rapid application development with minimal coding. By choosing a awesome self-hosted open-source low-code solution, businesses have greater control over their development environment, data privacy, and customization options, enabling them to build tailored applications that meet their specific needs.

1\. **Budibase**:
