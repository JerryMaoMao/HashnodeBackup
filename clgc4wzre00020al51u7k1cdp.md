## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital world, businesses need efficient and adaptable internal tools to manage their data and operations. Low-code platforms have emerged as a powerful solution, enabling organizations to build custom applications with minimal coding expertise.

In this blog, we will explore two popular low-code platforms, Retool and Appsmith, and compare their features, capabilities, and differences. We will also introduce ILLA Cloud, a managed service provider that supports these platforms, ensuring the smooth functioning of your internal tools.

## What are Low-Code Platforms?

Low-code platforms are software development frameworks that allow users to create custom applications with minimal coding expertise. These platforms leverage visual components, drag-and-drop interfaces, and pre-built templates, enabling users to build applications quickly and efficiently.

Low-code platforms are particularly popular for building internal tools, as they allow organizations to create custom solutions tailored to their unique needs, without the high costs and time-consuming processes associated with traditional software development.
