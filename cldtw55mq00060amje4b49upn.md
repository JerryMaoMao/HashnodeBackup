Low code development and traditional development are two approaches to create applications, each with its own advantages. Low code development uses code tools that allow business users to create applications without extensive coding knowledge. It provides a code development platform that speeds up the process of digital transformation and process automation for business applications.

On the other hand, traditional development requires a higher level of coding expertise to create applications from scratch. While low code development is faster and easier, traditional development offers more customization options for complex applications.

## **Low Code**

Low code development is a contemporary approach for the development of applications where the users will build a powerful customized application through drag-and-drop components of UI and ready connectors.

The Low code application is the standard tool for the internal teams of firms and businesses to experiment with app building and provide vision to the insights. This is a process of visual app development where the users design the front using drag-and-drop ready UI blocks, ready connectors database, ready business blocks of logic regarding workflows and action, one-click deployments, and validations.

These low-code helps in the visual development of applications through graphic interface and modeling. It enables the developers to deliver applications quickly by removing the complexity that comes with hand-coding. The platform works to improve the user experience of users.

## **Traditional Development**

There are many aspects of software development emphasizing the logic of the back end, databases, servers, architecture, and Programming interface. Concluding on the methodology to follow the Agile development, RAD, Waterfall, and Traditional application development is the approach towards the software development in which engineers need to code from scratch. Such an approach demands working in a team of programmers to collect specific requirements, design a development plan and work closely with a team to create some custom code.

Such an approach is good for building dream applications, but projects are usually more complex and time-consuming. Additionally, a motivated team needs to maintain and keep the application up-to-date. The traditional solution offer increased scalability. The developers will improve the app according to the requirements.

As the code is written from scratch, the applications are scalable and portable from inception. This app also offers an increased level of customization. The customer will get any functionality or feature they like.

## **Comparison**

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/low-code-or-traditional-development-comparison#1-developer-skills)

#### **1\. Developer Skills**

Low-code Platforms will be used by developers who are beginners and experts. The experts will experiment with different components to create customized applications while the beginners attain the best support for making an application without any complexity and hassle.

Similarly, traditional coding appeals to experts with increased technical skills. Hence, professional web developers with contemporary coding skills are employed to build applications. In the case of operating these applications, the user needs to be trained plus understand the knowledge in the domain.

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/low-code-or-traditional-development-comparison#2-tools-user-interface)

#### **2\. Tools (user interface)**

The low codes support the users of the business, citizen developers, and developers to build the applications rapidly, showcasing the vision. The Low code progresses and is developed through tools like DronaHQ. For the traditional development process, there are no specific tools. The IT engineers use the framework plus programming language to hand-code applications.

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/low-code-or-traditional-development-comparison#3-customization)

#### **3\. Customization:**

The developers will easily customize the applications to showcase the brand value, ideas, and vision with various prebuilt facets provided through platforms. The traditional approach offers increased customization as applications are coded from the base to meet specific requirements.

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/low-code-or-traditional-development-comparison#4-agility)

#### **4\. Agility**

The low code solutions advance agility as one can make variations quickly and easily. With updated features, automated testing, and reusable templates, the developers can accelerate the procedure of creating an app. Low code applications will also be used for advanced and retouched with no difficulty.

The application designed through the traditional approach is less agile than low-code solutions. The changes or updates in the application are slow and demand a dedicated team to update the variations every time.

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/low-code-or-traditional-development-comparison#5-quality)

#### **5\. Quality**

The low-code applications provide standard performance. Along with this, the services are error-free with live correcting plus integrating seamlessly with different productivity tools. The usual solutions are scalable at an increased rate, blending well with the remaining applications. The speed and performance are high, but testing and correcting require time.

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/low-code-or-traditional-development-comparison#6-deployment)

#### **6\. Deployment:**

The solution of low code will be deployed across different platforms rapidly. Moreover, This can work effectively in a cloud environment. Developers should develop web and mobile, such as the application created through traditional approaches separately for every platform.

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/low-code-or-traditional-development-comparison#7-maintenance)

#### **7\. Maintenance:**

The Low code solutions are easy to maintain. All low-code apps will be updated automatically when the firm edits the low-code platform. There are fewer expenses for regular maintenance. The traditional solutions are complex to maintain and regularly update.

Because of complex coding, one needs to have a dedicated team to edit the code. Consequently, the system updates the Low-code applications more frequently.

## **ILLA Cloud**

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/the-top-8-no-code-tools-in-2023#pros)**Pros**

This platform provides rich functionality, and the no-code tool user interface fills the gaps between workable applications and ideas. It helps the developers quickly market the products without any hassle.

The users can easily update the applications, and such tools’ maintenance is also very easy. In addition, working with such a tool requires just a single person to operate it, while other tools require a whole new team. Operating ILLA does not need a person to understand complex events, as using the platform is relatively easy.

#### [**​**](https://www.illacloud.com/blog/the-top-8-no-code-tools-in-2023#cons)**Cons**

One of the most significant limitations is linked to the templates they provide to the developers. By default, such templates have a specific range of functions and features, and the developers get restricted to them.

Therefore, when they need certain functions, and it’s not available on the template, it might cause a problem for the developers. The app is helpful for applications that aren’t complex. A full-fledged application requires a perfect learning curve, which is impossible with ILLA.
