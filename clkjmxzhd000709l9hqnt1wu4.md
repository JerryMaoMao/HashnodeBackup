## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building AI Anime Generators with ILLA Cloud

### Step 1: Sign Up and Create a New Project

Begin your journey by signing up on ILLA Cloud's website and creating a new project. Familiarize yourself with the intuitive [drag-and-drop](https://blog.illacloud.com/updated-drag-and-drop-feature-of-illa-cloud-revolutionizing-component-placement-and-layout/) builder, simplifying the app development process.

Create a new App in your builder and name it `AI Anime Generator`

### Step 2: Enable Hugging Face Integration

Within the project settings, activate Hugging Face integration. Gain access to a diverse range of AI models, including those for the anime generation.

Select `Hugging Face Inference API` from the action list.

### Step 3: Design the User Interface

Leverage ILLA Cloud's [drag-and-drop](https://blog.illacloud.com/updated-drag-and-drop-feature-of-illa-cloud-revolutionizing-component-placement-and-layout/) builder and extensive component library to design an engaging and interactive user interface for your AI anime generator.

Add an input component labeled as `Initial Prompt`, two button components labeled as `Clear` and `Generate`, a radio group labeled as `Example Prompt` with three items (optional), a radio group labeled as `Style` with five items (optional), an image component, and two button components labeled as `Save to ILLA Drive` and `Download` (optional). The overall layout can refer to the graph below.

### Step 4: Incorporate AI Animation Capabilities

Integrate Hugging Face's AI animation model into your ILLA Cloud project. Explore the fusion of AI and creativity, as animations come to life through your application.

After creating your Hugging Face action, copy the model name of the model you want to use from Hugging Face `Model ID` and put the value of the input component where users can input their prompt as a parameter to pass into the model. Here we use {{input1.value}}.

Repeat the above actions for every model you want to use if you want to generate different style for each prompt.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xCMM7MCJ8KLufhCMY8FucCnB0yumbLO8S8RtnB1iKdfVEberqajv64IkKeRmcKoxbqhTvUtS6ioCJURSRio372vKnhw25SZ314s6ArqU4RpydhamXam_uhM6wGBnLU0fcAKD8e5onLo0M78H-NODOC4 align="left")

### Step 5: Configuring the components

For the `Style` radio group, we can manually label and assign value to each option.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/s83sy61mBC3ilY0CVS4T3dsI9XDw6OGbYbkLqElSJpXlbggEQL3OdMoRa75nTjZQynID-rN_1N2fzo824y8WEQ39k7prpeSzsfQvERxaifz9gAmKGn8c7iN9pFmWQW21Rwk986l5jK79OMlw2vTXATw align="left")

For the `Generate` button, we want to click it to generate a new image with the input sentence as the input parameter through the hugging face.

1\. Click the  \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Trigger action\`\*\* for the `action` and choose the hugging face API you want to trigger (ie `cyberpunk`) for the `action name`

3\. In order to only run the picked model in the `Style` radio group, we put `{{radioButton2.value == 'cyberpunk'}}` for `Only run when`.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_pbGNVkj4cOrbZp6xyWtLSHKE3mRka9w2JgDsF6twmt8Y2U0vdcBkGGjv1PUxp4wC3_rlndzNP9S-1X2owycoBSNhTn1W-1qWWYGW1n3n3ukV4qLfY-kxgK2AaYPrPsRfM8jSJyKGHjRP9usBSqHbqo align="left")

For the `Clear` button, we want to click it to clear the texts in the input components.

1\. Click the \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Control components\`\*\* for action, choose `input1` for components, and `clearValue` for Method.

Similarly, we create multiple event handlers to clear the value for `Example Prompt` radio group to not be selected or set the value of `Style` radio group to set back to the default value.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/H7QD2GLpdaqjsP5pRO5nvBonIJc3P6KZrx5iI3L_LFO3jxCEPZ_1_FoH21ZrcRgEvSTEfKheX1FDH1RwDp_bhWwwfQ7cg33IyEw9XVzrU51ucaP2K2FsQ9brT9PsKVEDqFqOrb5Fbs_d7vzevznkmUA align="left")

For the image component to display the output image from each hugging face model, we can put `{{radioButton2.value == 'meina'? "data:image/jpeg;base64," +` [`Meina.data`](http://Meina.data) `: (radioButton2.value == 'kawaii'? "data:image/jpeg;base64,"+`[`kawaii.data`](http://kawaii.data) `: (radioButton2.value == 'cyberpunk'? "data:image/jpeg;base64," +`[`cyberpunk.data`](http://cyberpunk.data) `: (radioButton2.value == 'dreamlike'? "data:image/jpeg;base64," +`[`dreamlike.data`](http://dreamlike.data) `: "data:image/jpeg;base64," +`[`Pencil.data`](http://Pencil.data)`)) ) }}` into `Image Source`.
