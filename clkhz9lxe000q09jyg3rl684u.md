## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building a Stable Diffusion Prompt Generator

### Step 1: Sign Up and Create a New Project

Visit ILLA Cloud's website and sign up to create a new project. Familiarize yourself with the drag-and-drop coding environment, which eliminates the complexities of traditional coding websites.

Create a new App in your builder and name it `Prompt Generator`

### Step 2: Enable Hugging Face Integration

Access Hugging Face integration within the project settings to unlock a plethora of advanced AI models, including stable diffusion.

Select `Hugging Face Inference API` from the action list.

Fill out the configuration of Hugging Face with your Hugging Face token with `read` access from [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens?ref=illa-blog).

### Step 3: Design the User Interface

Utilize ILLA Cloud's drag-and-drop app builder and React Component Library to craft an appealing and interactive user interface for the [prompt](https://blog.illacloud.com/stable-diffusion-prompt-guide-and-how-to-connect-stable-diffusion-in-illa-cloud/) generator.

Add an input component, two button components labeled as `Clear` and `Submit`, a radio group labeled as `Prompt history` with three items (optional), a textarea component labeled as `Output prompt`. The overall layout can refer to the graph below.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6wbitaKiWUGb9c5TD1o1cpgWUsjNjyoXlLzIM6dnWVsOa8MzNX59Sj22lAmuVLlUTc-TZbl60iE9YqNK_Of0MVO2r8xgxqPcrxsvo14vECuXncBn1vPMZOmFJr2txvfYcXhh9l-yrws5IWp7k-H9CJE align="left")

### Step 4: Incorporate Stable Diffusion AI

Integrate Hugging Face's stable diffusion model into your project. Leverage the power of low code to optimize the integration process and achieve [prompt](https://blog.illacloud.com/stable-diffusion-prompt-guide-and-how-to-connect-stable-diffusion-in-illa-cloud/) generation with efficiency and accuracy.

After creating your Hugging Face action, copy the model name of the model you want to use from Hugging Face  `Model ID` and put the value of the input component where users can input their [prompt](https://blog.illacloud.com/stable-diffusion-prompt-guide-and-how-to-connect-stable-diffusion-in-illa-cloud/) as a parameter to pass into the model. Here we use `{{input1.value}}`.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4OxoGZl2uUJplzWL4YxA2hmiKUmK6cXxt8Vszga-yt3wRzMhgr6Umr5xlkh_MJ6EMCrTlRKUGmfItmJ4oME4A06PJ9q4jZUqLPlWL-ewYfy7jR1Z3P1ipAzl2DnjZ0yolMCGk75fRurm3p0-7oP_dCM align="left")

### Step 5: Configuring the button components

For the `Submit` button, we want to click it to generate a new stable diffusion [prompt](https://blog.illacloud.com/stable-diffusion-prompt-guide-and-how-to-connect-stable-diffusion-in-illa-cloud/) with the input sentence as the input parameter through hugging face.

1\. Click the \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Trigger action\`\*\* for the action and choose `huggingface1` for the action name

3\. In order to not pass empty strings into the data resource, we limit the button to only trigger hugging face when the input string is not empty or undefined. Put {{input1.value != '' && input1.value != undefined}} for Only run when.

For the `Clear` button, we want to click it to clear the texts in the input components.

1\. Click the \*\*\`button\`\*\* component to open its inspect page. Under \*\*\`Event handler\`\*\*, click `**+ New**`.

2\. In the Edit event handler, select \*\*\`Control components\`\*\* for action, choose `input1` for components, and `clearValue` for Method.

### Step 6: Configuring the textarea component to display the output prompt

To display the output image of the hugging face generated image, we put `{{`[`huggingface1.data`](http://huggingface1.data)`[0].generated_text}}` into the `Default value`of the textarea component.

### Step 7: Testing and Optimization

Thoroughly test the [prompt](https://blog.illacloud.com/stable-diffusion-prompt-guide-and-how-to-connect-stable-diffusion-in-illa-cloud/) generator to ensure its stability and reliability. Optimize the user interface and AI integration as needed to create a flawless [promp](https://blog.illacloud.com/stable-diffusion-prompt-guide-and-how-to-connect-stable-diffusion-in-illa-cloud/)t generation experience.

### Step 8: Deployment and User Engagement

Once satisfied with the [prompt](https://blog.illacloud.com/stable-diffusion-prompt-guide-and-how-to-connect-stable-diffusion-in-illa-cloud/) generator, deploy it to make it accessible to users worldwide. Engage with users, gather feedback, and continuously improve the generator's functionality based on user insights.
